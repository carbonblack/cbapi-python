## Summary

This set of tools uses the VMware Carbon Black Security Cloud Live Response APIs to retrieve artifacts generated by the Dell Trusted Device SafeBIOS verification service. The SafeBIOS console application can generate BIOS image files to the filesystem when a verification failure event is detected.

Incident responders can use this set of scripts to retrieve the image files for forensic analysis.


## Instructions

Usage:

To retrieve the BIOS image files from a device in a failed verification state via the Live Response API:


1. Copy the BiosVerification.py and dellbios.bat files to the same directory on the administrator system. 
2. Install the cbapi Python bindings: https://github.com/carbonblack/cbapi-python
3. Create necessary API keys and configure credentials on the administrator system: https://cbapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html 
4. Run the provided BiosVerification.py utility with the following command line to target the failed system:
```
BiosVerification.py --get --machinename <MACHINE NAME>
```

If failed BIOS image files are found the script will retrieve the image files to the local administrator system in a compressed archive named 
```
<MACHINE NAME>-BiosImages.zip
```

## Example

```
$ ./BiosVerification.py --get --machinename "DPENNY\LT-7400"
