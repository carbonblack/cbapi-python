cbapi: Carbon Black API for Python
==================================

Release v\ |release|.

CBAPI provides a straightforward interface to the VMware Carbon Black products Carbon Black EDR and Carbon Black App Control.
This library provides a Pythonic layer to access the raw power of the REST APIs of these Carbon Black products, making it easier to query data from on-premise APIs, combine data from multiple API calls, manage all API credentials in one place, and manipulate data as Python objects. Take a look::

   >>> from cbapi.response import CbResponseAPI, Process, Binary, Sensor
   >>> #
   >>> # Create our EDR API object
   >>> #
   >>> c = CbResponseAPI()
   >>> #
   >>> # take the first process that ran notepad.exe, download the binary and read the first two bytes
   >>> #
   >>> c.select(Process).where('process_name:notepad.exe').first().binary.file.read(2)
   'MZ'
   >>> #
   >>> # if you want a specific ID, you can put it straight into the .select() call:
   >>> #
   >>> binary = c.select(Binary, "24DA05ADE2A978E199875DA0D859E7EB")
   >>> #
   >>> # select all sensors that have ran notepad
   >>> #
   >>> sensors = set()
   >>> for proc in c.select(Process).where('process_name:evil.exe'):
   ...     sensors.add(proc.sensor)
   >>> #
   >>> # iterate over all sensors and isolate
   >>> #
   >>> for s in sensors:
   ...     s.network_isolation_enabled = True
   ...     s.save()

If you're a Carbon Black App Control customer (formerly CB Protection), you may use::

   >>> from cbapi.protection.models import FileInstance
   >>> from cbapi.protection import CbProtectionAPI
   >>> #
   >>> # Create our App Control API object
   >>> #
   >>> p = CbProtectionAPI()
   >>> #
   >>> # Select the first file instance
   >>> #
   >>> fi = p.select(FileInstance).first()
   >>> #
   >>> # print that computer's hostname. This automatically "joins" with the Computer API object.
   >>> #
   >>> fi.computer.name
   u'DOMAIN\\MYHOSTNAME'
   >>> #
   >>> # change the policy ID
   >>> #
   >>> fi.computer.policyId = 3
   >>> fi.computer.save()


Major Features
--------------

- **Enhanced Live Response API**
    The new CBAPI now provides a robust interface to the Carbon Black EDR Live Response capability.
    Easily create Live Response sessions, initiate commands on remote hosts, and pull down data as
    necessary to make your Incident Response process much more efficient and automated.

- **Consistent API across VMware Carbon Black platforms**
    CBAPI supports Carbon Black EDR and Carbon Black App Control customers from a single API layer. Even better,
    the object model is the same for all three, and if you know one API, you can easily transition to another. CBAPI
    manages the differences among the two REST APIs behind a single, consistent Python-like interface.

- **Enhanced Performance**
    CBAPI now provides a built in caching layer to reduce the query load on the Carbon Black server. This is especially
    useful when taking advantage of CBAPI's new "joining" features. You can transparently access, for example, the
    binary associated with a given process in Carbon Black EDR. Since many processes may be associated
    with the same binary, it does not make sense to repeatedly request the same binary information from the server
    over and over again. Therefore CBAPI now caches this information to avoid unnecessary requests.

- **Reduce Complexity**
    CBAPI provides a friendly interface for accessing Carbon Black data. This greatly improves developer
    productivity and lowers the bar to entry.

- **Python 3 and Python 2 compatible**
    Use all the new features and modules available in Python 3 with CBAPI. This module is compatible with Python
    versions 2.6.6 and above, 2.7.x, 3.4.x, and 3.5.x.

- **Better support for multiple CB servers**
    CBAPI introduces the concept of Credential Profiles; named collections of URL, API keys, and optional proxy
    configuration for connecting to any number of Carbon Black EDR or Carbon Black App Control servers.


API Credentials
---------------

CBAPI version 0.9.0 enforces the use of credential files.

In order to perform any queries via the API, you will need to get the API token for your CB user. See the documentation
on the Developer Network website on how to acquire the API token for
`Carbon Black EDR (CB Response) <http://developer.carbonblack.com/reference/enterprise-response/authentication/>`_, or
`Carbon Black App Control (CB Protection) <http://developer.carbonblack.com/reference/enterprise-protection/authentication/>`_.

Once you acquire your API token, place it in one of the default credentials file locations:

* ``/etc/carbonblack/``
* ``~/.carbonblack/``
* ``/current_working_directory/.carbonblack/``

For distinction between credentials of different Carbon Black products, use the following naming convention for your
credentials files:

* ``credentials.response`` for Carbon Black EDR (CB Response)
* ``credentials.protection`` for Carbon Black App Control (CB Protection)

For example, if you use Carbon Black EDR, you should have created a credentials file in one of these
locations:

* ``/etc/carbonblack/credentials.response``
* ``~/.carbonblack/credentials.response``
* ``/current_working_directory/.carbonblack/credentials.response``

Credentials found in a later path will overwrite earlier ones.

The credentials are stored in INI format. The name of each credential profile is enclosed in square brackets, followed
by key-value pairs providing the necessary credential information::

    [default]
    url=https://localhost
    token=abcdef0123456789abcdef
    ssl_verify=False

    [prod]
    url=https://cbserver.prod.corp.com
    token=aaaaaa
    ssl_verify=True

    [otheruser]
    url=https://localhost
    token=bbbbbb
    ssl_verify=False

The possible options for each credential profile are:

* **url**: The base URL of the Carbon Black server. This should include the protocol (https) and the hostname, and nothing else.
* **token**: The API token for the user ID. More than one credential profile can be specified for a given server, with
  different tokens for each.
* **ssl_verify**: True or False; controls whether the SSL/TLS certificate presented by the server is validated against
  the local trusted CA store.
* **proxy**: A proxy specification that will be used when connecting to the Carbon Black server. The format is:
  ``http://myusername:mypassword@proxy.company.com:8001/`` where the hostname of the proxy is ``proxy.company.com``, port
  8001, and using username/password ``myusername`` and ``mypassword`` respectively.
* **ignore_system_proxy**: If you have a system-wide proxy specified, setting this to True will force CBAPI to bypass
  the proxy and directly connect to the Carbon Black server.

Future versions of CBAPI will also provide the ability to "pin" the TLS certificate so as to provide certificate
verification on self-signed or internal CA signed certificates.

Environment Variable Support

The latest CBAPI for Python supports specifying API credentials in the following three environment variables:

`CBAPI_TOKEN` the envar for holding the EDR (CbR) or App Control (CbP) api token.

The `CBAPI_URL` envar holds the FQDN of the target, an EDR (CbR) server specified just as they are in the
configuration file format specified above.

The  optional `CBAPI_SSL_VERIFY` envar can be used to control SSL validation(True/False or 0/1), which will default to
ON when not explicitly set by the user.

For environments where complex outbound network filters and proxy configurations are used (eg. anything other than
an unauthenticated or basic password authenticated proxy) a prepared `requests.Session` object may be supplied as a
`proxy_session` parameter. This session will then be used for all communication with the API. Construction of such a
`Session` is beyond the scope of this document, consult your local network/security administrators for assistance.

Backwards & Forwards Compatibility
----------------------------------

The previous versions (0.8.x and earlier) of CBAPI and bit9Api are now deprecated and will no longer receive updates.
However, existing scripts will work without change as CBAPI includes both in its legacy package.
The legacy package is imported by default and placed in the top level CBAPI namespace when the CBAPI module
is imported on a Python 2.x interpreter. Therefore, scripts that expect to import cbapi.CbApi will continue to work
exactly as they had previously.

Since the old API was not compatible with Python 3, the legacy package is not importable in Python 3.x and therefore
legacy scripts cannot run under Python 3.

Once CBAPI 1.0.0 is released, the old :py:mod:`cbapi.legacy.CbApi` will be deprecated and removed entirely no earlier
than January 2017.
New scripts should use the :py:mod:`cbapi.response.rest_api.CbResponseAPI`
(for Carbon Black EDR (CB Response)), :py:mod:`cbapi.protection.rest_api.CbProtectionAPI`
(for Carbon Black App Control (CB Protection)), or :py:mod:`cbapi.defense.rest_api.CbDefenseAPI` API entry points.

The API is frozen as of version 1.0; any changes in the 1.x version branch
will be additions/bug fixes only. Breaking changes to the API will increment the major version number (2.x).
